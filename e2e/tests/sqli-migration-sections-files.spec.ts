/**
 * Covers two of this task's four converted files whose queries are reachable
 * through a normal page view without altering any shared/global competition
 * state:
 *  - sections/brewer_entries.sec.php's $query_eval_exists (now
 *    $db_conn->get()) runs unconditionally on every ?section=list view
 *    whenever prefsEval=1, which this stack's seeded baseline always is.
 *  - includes/headers.inc.php's $query_contact (now $db_conn->getOne())
 *    renders the "message sent" confirmation on ?section=contact&msg=1.
 *
 * sections/login.sec.php's confirmed SQLi is covered separately in
 * login-verify-sqli.spec.ts.
 *
 * The other two converted queries in this task - both in
 * sections/winners.sec.php, and the nested (eval-row) branch of
 * sections/brewer_entries.sec.php's $query_style - are reachable only after
 * flipping prefsDisplayWinners to 'Y' (resp. $show_scores, which requires
 * judging to have closed). This stack's prefsDisplayWinners=N is a
 * deliberate fixture choice from an earlier task so entrant journeys run
 * pre-judging (see admin-journey.spec.ts's header comment), and workers:1
 * doesn't make flipping a shared preferences row safe against *other*
 * sessions concurrently using this same long-lived dev stack. Those two
 * queries are instead covered by a source-level regression guard in
 * tests/Unit/SourceHardeningTest.php, and were verified manually against a
 * throwaway admin session during this task (see that task's report).
